# Application Package Abstract Processor

## Allgemeiner Paket-Aufbereitungs-Prozessor

The idea of this project is to extract documentation from the SAP development workbench and present it outside of the SAP system. The outside presentation will be generated by an XSLT process.

In the first stage, the generated documentation features the display of various SAP repository objects in a javadoc-style HTML documentation.

Future stages may include the generation of PDF files.

If you have questions about the project, please post them at [this article in the SAP Developer Network code gallery](http://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/Snippets/Generate+javadoc-style+documentation+of+SAP+repository+objects).
